### v0.2.0 (2022-07-05)

* Adds an additional path to register `next-server` when running a Next.js app with a standalone server.

* **BREAKING**: Fixed instrumentation to only support middleware in  >=12.2.0 of Next.js
   * Next.js has made middleware [stable](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware).  All attempts to track middleware before 12.2.0 have been removed.

Bump NPM dependencies to their latest version
