# Monis Agent Next.js instrumentation [![Next.js Instrumentation CI][1]][2]

This is Monis Agent's official Next.js framework instrumentation for use with the Monis Agent [Node.js agent](https://github.com/Cryptoking28/monisagent).

This module is a dependency of the agent and is installed by default when you install the agent.

This module provides instrumentation for server-side rendering via [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware), and Monis Agent transaction naming for both page and server requests. It does not provide any instrumentation for actions occurring during build or in client-side code.  If you want telemetry data on actions occurring on the client (browser), you can [inject the browser agent](./docs/inject-browser-agent.md).

Here are documents for more in-depth explanations about [transaction naming](./docs/transactions.md), [segments/spans](./docs/segments-and-spans.md), and [injecting the browser agent](./docs/inject-browser-agent.md).

**Note**: The minimum supported Next.js version is [12.0.9](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.0.9).

## Installation

Typically, most users use the version auto-installed by the agent. You can see agent install instructions [here](https://github.com/Cryptoking28/monisagent#installation-and-getting-started).

In some cases, installing a specific version is ideal. For example, new features or major changes might be released via a major version update to this module, prior to inclusion in the main Monis Agent Node.js agent.

```
npm install @monisagent/next
```

```js
NODE_OPTIONS='-r @monisagent/next' next start
```

If you cannot control how your program is run, you can load the `@monisagent/next` module before any other module in your program. However, we strongly suggest you avoid this method at all costs.  We found bundling when running `next build` causes problems and also will make your bundle unnecessarily large.

```js
require('@monisagent/next')

/* ... the rest of your program ... */
```

### Custom Next.js servers

If you are using next as a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server), you're probably not running your application with the `next` CLI.  In that scenario we recommend running the Next.js instrumentation as follows.

```js
node -r @monisagent/next your-program.js
```

For more information, please see the agent [installation guide][3].

## Getting Started

Our [API and developer documentation](http://monisagent.github.io/node-monisagent/docs/) for writing instrumentation will be of help. We particularly recommend the tutorials and various "shim" API documentation.

## Client-side Instrumentation

Next.js is a full stack React Framework. This module augments the Node.js Monis Agent agent, thus any client-side actions will not be instrumented. However, below is a method of adding the [Monis Agent Browser agent](https://docs.monisagent.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) to get more information on client-side actions.

```js
import Head from 'next/head'
import Layout, { siteTitle } from '../../components/layout'
import utilStyles from '../../styles/utils.module.css'
import Link from 'next/link'


export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // You must require agent and put it within this function
  // otherwise it will try to get bundled by webpack and cause errors.
  const monisagent = require('monisagent')
  const browserTimingHeader = monisagent.getBrowserTimingHeader()
  return {
    props: {
      browserTimingHeader
    }
  }
}

export default function Home({ browserTimingHeader }) {
  return (
    <Layout home>
      <Head>
        <title>{siteTitle}</title>
      </Head>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: browserTimingHeader }} />
      <section className={utilStyles.headingMd}>
        <p>It me</p>
        <p>
          This page uses server-side rendering and uses the monisagent API to inject
          timing headers.
        </p>
        <div>
          <Link href="/">
            <a>‚Üê Back to home</a>
          </Link>
        </div>
      </section>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

For static compiled pages, you can use the [copy-paste method](https://docs.monisagent.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#copy-paste-app) for enabling the Monis Agent Browser agent.

For more information, please see the agent [compatibility and requirements][4].

### Error Handling

For capturing both the client and server side errors it is best to use `pages/_error.js` pattern recommended by Next.js documentation on [Advanced Error Page Customization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#more-advanced-error-page-customizing)

This pattern can be used to send either client, server or both types of errors to Monis Agent.

```js
function Error({ statusCode }) {
  return (
    <p>
      {statusCode
        ? `An error ${statusCode} occurred on server`
        : "An error occurred on client"}
    </p>
  );
}

Error.getInitialProps = ({ res, err }) => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    const monisagent = require('monisagent');
    monisagent.noticeError(err);
  } else {
    window.monisagent.noticeError(err);
  }

  const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : 404;
  return { statusCode };
};

export default Error;
```

The example above assumes that both the Monis Agent Browser and Node agents are integrated. `getInitialProps` function's `if` statement checks whether an error was thrown on the server side (`typeof window === "undefined"`) and if it was the case, it `requires` Monis Agent Node agent and sends an `err` with `noticeError` method. Otherwise it assumes the error was throw on the front-end side, and uses the browser agent to send the error to Monis Agent by using `window.monisagent.noticeError(err)`.

## Testing

The module includes a suite of unit and functional tests which should be used to
verify that your changes don't break existing functionality.

All tests are stored in `tests/` and are written using
[Tap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap) with the extension `.test.js`(unit), or `.tap.js`(versioned).

To run the full suite, run: `npm test`.

Individual test scripts include:

```
npm run unit
npm run versioned
```
