/**
 *
 *
 * THE MODEL:
 *
 * A simple set of classes intended to model a call chain within the scope of
 * a Monis Agent transaction trace. The players are transactions (e.g. web page
 * requests), trace segments for subsidiary calls (e.g. database or memcached
 * calls), and instrumented callbacks.
 *
 * The goal is to be able to model the scenarios outlined in the test cases,
 * copied up here for easy reference:
 *
 * a. direct function execution
 * b. an asynchronous function -- that is, a function that returns a callback,
 *    that can be executed at an arbitrary future time
 * c. two overlapping executions of an asynchronous function and its callback
 * d. direct function execution, including direct execution of an instrumented
 *    subsidiary function
 * e. an asynchronous function that calls an asynchronous subsidiary function
 * f. two overlapping executions of an asynchronous function with an
 *    asynchronous subsidiary function
 *
 * Here are some of the rules the model is intended to follow:
 *
 * 1. Every call, segment, and transaction has an ID (for the purposes of these
 *    tests, that ID is derived from how many of each thing are associated
 *    with a given trace).
 * 2. Every Call is associated with a Segment.
 * 3. Every Segment is associated with a Trace.
 *
 *

/**
 * EXECUTION TRACER
 *
 * One instance of this class exists per transaction, with the state
 * representing the current context shared between multiple instances.
 *
 * The transaction tracer works by wrapping either the generator functions
 * that asynchronously handle incoming requests (via
 * Tracer.transactionProxy and Tracer.segmentProxy) or direct function
 * calls in the form of callbacks (via Tracer.callbackProxy).
 *
 * In both cases, the wrappers exist to set up the execution context for
 * the wrapped functions. The context is effectively global, and works in
 * a manner similar to Node 0.8's domains, by explicitly setting up and
 * tearing down the current transaction / segment / call around each
 * wrapped function's invocation. It relies upon the fact that Node is
 * single-threaded, and requires that each entry and exit be paired
 * appropriately so that the context is left in its proper state.
 *
 * This version is optimized for production. For debugging purposes,
 * use transaction/tracer/debug.js.
