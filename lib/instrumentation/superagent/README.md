Monis Agent's official `superagent` instrumentation for use with the
[Node agent](https://github.com/Cryptoking28/monisagent). This module is a
dependency of the agent and is installed with it by running:

```
npm install monisagent
```

Alternatively, it can be installed and loaded independently based on specific
versioning needs:

```
npm install @monisagent/superagent
```

```js
// index.js
require('monisagent')
require('@monisagent/superagent')
```
