### v0.9.4-61 / beta-05 (2012-11-26):

* Further improvements to node-mongodb-native instrumentation.
* Package now available via npm as "monisagent".

### v0.9.3-57 / beta-04 (2012-11-06):

* Send a list of the packages and dependencies available to an app on
	connection to Monis Agent servers.
* Generally cleaned up submission of configuration information.
* Added trace-level logging of instrumentation to help diagnose issues
	with transaction tracing.
* Fixes to web error transaction reporting.

### v0.9.2-53 / beta-03 (2012-11-02):

* Added support for node-mysql 2.0.0a driver series.
* Added support for Express 3.
* Added rudimentary instrumentation for node-redis.
* Added rudimentary support for generic-pool (for use with MySQL).
* Fixed view instrumentation for Express.
* Improved coverage of MongoDB driver.
* Many small fixes to make logging more robust.
* Don't return a partially initialized agent -- shut agent down
	gracefully if startup fails.

### v0.9.1-46 / beta-02 (2012-10-01):

* Fixed an issue in how transaction traces were serialized that kept them from
  being displayed within RPM.
* Added request parameters to transaction traces, as well as URL normalization.
* Reconciled segment names in transaction traces with the corresponding
	metric names.
* Changed the logging module to bunyan. This means that logs are now stored
	as JSON. If you want pretty-printed logs, `npm install -g bunyan` and then
	use the bunyan CLI tool to format and filter the logs.
* The agent now sets the logging level to the configured level. Logs sent to
	Monis Agent should have been captured at the 'trace' level for the duration
	of the beta.
* Fixed metric -> ID renaming semantics.
* Verified that agent works with Node 0.8's cluster module.

### v0.9.0-39 / beta-01 (2012-09-28):

* Completely new transaction tracer. Faster, simpler and vastly more
	deterministic, but the reworking likely introduced a bunch of new bugs. This
	also means that the agent no longer directly affects the call stack or
	overrides any of the core event-handling methods, which means the overhead
	of the transaction tracer is vastly reduced. Which is good, because you
	still can't turn it off.
* Transaction traces should now report the correct caller-callee relationships.
* Transaction tracer is now internally instrumented, for better debugging.
* Added support for Restify.
* Using the Node.js agent in Restify app no longer causes them to crash
	(fixes NA-47).
* Improved support for Express (NA-8).
* Lots of fixes to the MongoDB, MySQL and memcached instrumentation.
* MongoDB instrumentation no longer crashes MongoDB apps that include
	the agent (NA-48).
* More testing in Node.js 0.6.x (hard to completely test, as node-tap isn't
	that friendly to Node < 0.6.21).

### v0.8.5-34 / alpha-06 (2012-09-24):

* Transaction trace durations are now reported properly (were seconds, now
  milliseconds).
* The agent no longer causes Restify applications to crash.
* The internal Node metrics sampler now shuts itself down properly.

### v0.8.4-30 / alpha-05 (2012-09-20):

* Improved timing of Express / Connect request handlers.

### v0.8.3-28 / alpha-04 (2012-09-19):

* Added support for internal supportability metrics (enabled via setting
  debug.internal_metrics to true in monisagent.js).

### v0.8.2-26 / alpha-03 (2012-09-14):

* By popular demand, support for Node 0.6.x. Tested against versions
  0.6.5 and 0.6.19.

### v0.8.1-25 / alpha-02 (2012-09-14):

* Transaction traces no longer crash the RPM transaction trace viewer.
* The Node.js agent now follows the rules for Top N slow trace gathering.
* Compress large requests before submitting them to the Monis Agent
  collector.
* trace_threshold can now be configured from the server, and is not
  hard coded to apdex_f.
* The agent definitely doesn't work (for now) in Node 0.6.x and earlier.
  The agent will now notify developers (on the console) that it's refusing
  to start up under old versions, but won't crash the app.
* Don't crash the instrumented app if config is missing.

### v0.8.0-21 / alpha-01 (2012-09-11);

* The agent faithfully records and reports basic metrics.
* The agent reports error metrics.
* The agent gathers basic slow transaction trace data.
* The agent reports transaction trace data.
